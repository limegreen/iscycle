I am also a member of the Physical Activity for Health Research Cluster at the Health Research Institute. Previously, I was based at the University of Otago in Aotearoa/New Zealand.\r\n            My interests are interdisciplinary and broad, but can be grouped into:\r\n            Health — I apply psychology to questions in health. A lot of what I do is quite culturally located, trying to understand health behaviour in different locations: Indonesia, Pakistan, New Zealand, Ireland. Recent specific projects include looking at the use of various substances for improving academic performance, using n-of-1 interventions to increase physical activity, and publication bias in health fields.\r\n            Data/Methods — My very first research project in my third year of university used multivariate statistics, and I was teaching assistant for a third year statistics paper in the first year of my PhD, and have been teaching statistics/research methods on and off ever since. I support openness and transparency, and have recently published a paper promoting the use count regression (Poisson, negative binomial etc.). I am also very interested in publication bias.\r\n            Education — Having spent many years doing admissions for health professional programmes, I’ve done some work on admissions processes. I also recently completed a Masters in Teaching & Learning, with my dissertation looking at increasing student engagement with research methods courses.\r\n            Wine — I don’t really do this much any more, but historically, I’ve done quite a bit looking at perception of flavour in wine, mostly Sauvignon blanc.\r\n            Coffee — Just kidding. Even my interests are not that broad. I do drink a lot of coffee, and we roast our own green beans.\r\n            Random — There could be more sub-headings here, but along the way, I’ve been involved on lots of other projects. Some of my much older/original work was in sociolinguistics, and there are lots of things I’ve got involved in with friends.\r\n            If you want to dig in, probably check out my Google Scholar profile\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              About James\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Publications\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       GitLab (code)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       OSF (data)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Orcid (pubs)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Publons (peer review)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Github (old code)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       ResearcherID\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Scopus\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              I am a researcher and teacher at the School of Allied Health, University of Limerick.

I explore decision-making about medicines, including adherence, preventive health behaviours, and how culture influences medicine taking behaviour and understanding. I examine communication between healthcare professionals, and between healthcare professionals and patients.\r\nMethodology\r\nEducation\r\nI have a strong interest in admissions processes and predictors of academic success, initially as part of a role on a pharmacy admissions committee trying to increase the number of Maori students gain entry. I have reviewed a good number of papers in this area for Medical Education and Advances in Health Sciences Education.\r\nGreen, J.A., (2015). The effect of English proficiency and ethnicity on academic performance and progress. Advances in Health Sciences Education, 20, 219-228. doi: 10.1007/s10459-014-9523-7\r\nI also have been involved in several interprofessional education projects, and currently teach an interprofessional cohort in allied health.\r\nFor my Master of Arts in Teaching Learning and Scholarship, I’ve also been blending my interest in methods with education. I’m a long time teacher of research methods and/or statistics, mostly to postgraduate professional cohorts. My project, which will be highlighted here soon, is looking at innovativion in research methods teaching.\r\nWine\r\nNo longer such an active area for me [sadface], but through a long collaboration with Wendy Parr (Lincoln University, Marlborough Wine Research Centre) and a number of her French collaborators (Dominique Valentin and others), we demonstrated that wine experts have a clear cognitive prototypes that influence their perceptions. We have also delineated sensory and physicochemical differences between different national and sub-national wine regions for Sauvignon blanc.\r\nThe last project I worked on here was looking to see whether the position of the moon per the biodynamic calendar influenced perceptions of wine. It did not [mic drop]\r\nParr, W. V., Valentin, D., Reedman, P., Grose, C., & Green, J. A. (2017). Expectation or Sensorial Reality? An Empirical Investigation of the Biodynamic Calendar for Wine Drinkers. PloS one, 12, e0169257. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169257 \r\nI narrowly missed a large scale Marsden Fund grant in this area in 2005, which had it been successful, might have led to me having a very different career!\r\nRandom\r\nMy PhD (2004) was located at the intersection of social psychology and sociolinguistics, but even back then, I had rather broad interests. I’ve had an extended but peripheral involvement in evaluating different accents of English, for example. And have a stack of file-drawered studies on the reasons analysis effect — listing your reasons underlying a judgement messes with your judgement. One of these is published, showing a carryover effect from reasoning to subsequent judgements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
