Green who is also a psychology PhD!!), I needed to find a unique handle, and theJamesGreen seemed a bit pretentious. So I’m just aJamesGreen, one of many!\r\n\r\nThe other James A. Green at the University of Connecticut is an expert in infant crying and also department chair — not one of my ambitions. His first publication was around the year I was born\r\nThis page is not a CV, but more a narrative of my career so far.\r\nMy career as a garden of forking paths1\r\nUp until the end of my PhD, I had had a fairly linear path. And, after I submitted, I nearly landed a confirmation-path (tenure-track) job in the psychology department I trained in, which would have continued with an obvious linear path. I would have developed my own independent research agenda, but it would still have obviously lead on from my PhD.\r\nHowever, I didn’t land that job, and so started applying elsewhere. I nearly2 ended up with a post-doc in Cardiff. In reflecting on the forking paths of academia, I’ve found it interesting that neither the successful candidate, nor the PI on the project appear to still be in academia.\r\nInstead, I ended up — after a fortuitous discussion at the photocopier — with a research role with Geoff White. The original scope for that role was mostly to be supporting a very strongly behaviourist project, but after some detour into prospective memory, I ended up doing lots of stuff on Sauvignon blanc.\r\nWhile in that post, I got a grant through to the second round of New Zealand’s prestigious Marsden Fund. Had that been successful, I would have had three years as a co-PI of a $600,000+ project with a wine budget 3, exploring the following:\r\n\r\nSensory science studies of aroma and flavour emphasise chemosensory properties of wine as the dominant source for judgments about wine quality. Smells and tastes are percepts that do not exist outside of the human observer, however, so an analysis of wine judgment that emphasises only chemosensory properties is incomplete. According to recent studies of the way that wine is perceived and judged, the sensory experience of wine is ambiguous and may be open to interpretation, with marked individual differences among even wine experts. Therefore, wine memory and perception are likely to be predominantly influenced by processes of construction and interpretation. Further, wine drinking or tasting is typically a social experience, and the ambiguous nature of wine allows a powerful influence by social factors, which have not been explored. The novel question of our proposal is whether wine judgements are subject to memory illusions and social influence. We propose to apply some classic procedures that can reveal distortions in normal memory over time and the influence of social situations on perception, in order to demonstrate memory illusions and social contagion in wine judgements and memory. 4\r\n\r\nHowever, obviously, I never got that Marsden, or the FRST post-doc exploring Pinot Noir5, and instead got a confirmation-path (tenure-track) post teaching communication skills and psychology to pharmacy students. I had a really fruitful twelve and a bit years in the School of Pharmacy, but I was excited for a broader role and the possibility of travel. There was a fair bit of serendipity involved, but I was delighted to move up and sideways to a new health psychology post in the School of Allied Health at the University of Limerick.\r\nCastling\r\nOne of the joys of living in Ireland is that the historical stuff is so different to the New World/Aotearoa. Bronze age stone circles, passage tombs etc. from 6000 years ago, to the Norman Tower houses, and more modern Palladian country houses. We visit a lot, and have started to refer to these trips as castling!\r\n\r\nVisiting a pa site — a fortified structure on a hill — is the closest equivalent in Aotearoa\r\n\r\nwith apologies to Andrew Gelman↩︎\r\nI wouldn’t say ‘nearly’ usually, but they only interviewed two candidates, and I was apparently appointable↩︎\r\nI’m actually really disappointed that the wine was going to be a very small part of the overall cost, only about $10,000 or so↩︎\r\nThis abstract has never been outside a rather small group of people!↩︎\r\nI tried!!↩︎\r\n",

Previously, I was based at the University of Otago in Aotearoa/New Zealand.\r\n            My interests are interdisciplinary and broad, but can be grouped into:\r\n            Health — I apply psychology to questions in health. A lot of what I do is quite culturally located, trying to understand health behaviour in different locations: Indonesia, Pakistan, New Zealand, Ireland. Recent specific projects include looking at the use of various substances for improving academic performance, using n-of-1 interventions to increase physical activity, and publication bias in health fields.\r\n            Data/Methods — My very first research project in my third year of university used multivariate statistics, and I was teaching assistant for a third year statistics paper in the first year of my PhD, and have been teaching statistics/research methods on and off ever since. I support openness and transparency, and have recently published a paper promoting the use count regression (Poisson, negative binomial etc.). I am also very interested in publication bias.\r\n            Education — Having spent many years doing admissions for health professional programmes, I’ve done some work on admissions processes. I also recently completed a Masters in Teaching & Learning, with my dissertation looking at increasing student engagement with research methods courses.\r\n            Wine — I don’t really do this much any more, but historically, I’ve done quite a bit looking at perception of flavour in wine, mostly Sauvignon blanc.\r\n            Coffee — Just kidding. Even my interests are not that broad. I do drink a lot of coffee, and we roast our own green beans.\r\n            Random — There could be more sub-headings here, but along the way, I’ve been involved on lots of other projects. Some of my much older/original work was in sociolinguistics, and there are lots of things I’ve got involved in with friends.\r\n            If you want to dig in, probably check out my Google Scholar profile\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              James Green\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Publications\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       GitLab (code)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       OSF (data)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Orcid (pubs)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Publons (peer review)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Github (old code)\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       ResearcherID\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Scopus\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              I am a researcher and teacher at the School of Allied Health, University of Limerick.
