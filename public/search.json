I explore decision-making about medicines, including adherence, preventive health behaviours, and how culture influences medicine taking behaviour and understanding. I examine communication between healthcare professionals, and between healthcare professionals and patients.\r\nMethodology\r\nEducation\r\nI have a strong interest in admissions processes and predictors of academic success, initially as part of a role on a pharmacy admissions committee trying to increase the number of Maori students gain entry. I have reviewed a good number of papers in this area for Medical Education and Advances in Health Sciences Education.\r\nGreen, J.A., (2015). The effect of English proficiency and ethnicity on academic performance and progress. Advances in Health Sciences Education, 20, 219-228. doi: 10.1007/s10459-014-9523-7\r\nI also have been involved in several interprofessional education projects, and currently teach an interprofessional cohort in allied health.\r\nFor my Master of Arts in Teaching Learning and Scholarship, I’ve also been blending my interest in methods with education. I’m a long time teacher of research methods and/or statistics, mostly to postgraduate professional cohorts. My project, which will be highlighted here soon, is looking at innovativion in research methods teaching.\r\nWine\r\nNo longer such an active area for me [sadface], but through a long collaboration with Wendy Parr (Lincoln University, Marlborough Wine Research Centre) and a number of her French collaborators (Dominique Valentin and others), we demonstrated that wine experts have a clear cognitive prototypes that influence their perceptions. We have also delineated sensory and physicochemical differences between different national and sub-national wine regions for Sauvignon blanc.\r\nThe last project I worked on here was looking to see whether the position of the moon per the biodynamic calendar influenced perceptions of wine. It did not [mic drop]\r\nParr, W. V., Valentin, D., Reedman, P., Grose, C., & Green, J. A. (2017). Expectation or Sensorial Reality? An Empirical Investigation of the Biodynamic Calendar for Wine Drinkers. PloS one, 12, e0169257. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169257 \r\nI narrowly missed a large scale Marsden Fund grant in this area in 2005, which had it been successful, might have led to me having a very different career!\r\nRandom\r\nMy PhD (2004) was located at the intersection of social psychology and sociolinguistics, but even back then, I had rather broad interests. I’ve had an extended but peripheral involvement in evaluating different accents of English, for example. And have a stack of file-drawered studies on the reasons analysis effect — listing your reasons underlying a judgement messes with your judgement. One of these is published, showing a carryover effect from reasoning to subsequent judgements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
