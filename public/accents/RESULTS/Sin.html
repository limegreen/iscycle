Only the male American was correctly identified by a majority, with pluralities also identifying the female NAm, male AusE, and female EE voices as American.  Almost as many guessed the male EE voice to be American (20%) as thought he was English (23%).</LI></UL><HR><P><B>B. 67 Boys' High School students</B><BR>Mean age 12.6<BR>(collected by Niti Pawakapan)</P><IMG SRC="SinG2.gif" WIDTH=425 HEIGHT=342 BORDER=0 ALT="Personality Trait Means"><P><B>Singapore Boys' High School Accent Guesses</B><BR>Majority/plurality percentage for each speaker in <B>boldface</B>;<BR>Major erroneous guesses <I>italicised</I></P><IMG SRC="SinT2.gif" WIDTH=474 HEIGHT=132 BORDER=0 ALT="Accent Guesses"><P>Points to note:</P><UL><LI>In comparing these results with the other high school sample (<A HREF="EngCorn.html"><U>Cornwall, UK</U></A>), the most striking similarity is the marked compression of range in mean trait values in the status and power dimensions, and the equally marked width of variation in assignment of the solidarity traits.Once again, the two NAm voices are clear leaders here, with the two EE voices and the NZE male at the bottom in solidarity.</LI><LI>As with the NUS sample above, in no case did a majority choose the correct national/ethnic group of a voice, but the two NAm voices were correctly identified by a large number--51% and 49% if we count both American and Canadian as correct. </LI><LI>Only 21% correctly identified the EE male, and even less for the EE female voice (12%), which 21% took to be Canadian.</LI><LI>21% identified the AusE male as Black American! Pluralities also identified the female AusE voice as American. "American" is seemingly the most salient accent to both Singapore samples. </LI><LI>It is interesting to note the favourite TV programmes watched: in most popular place "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" (40%) is followed by "Survivor" (11%); in second place, "Millionaire?" appears again (17%), followed by "Survivor" and sports (11% each); in third place the only local programme ("Channel Newsasia") appears, tied with films at 10% each.</LI></UL><HR><P CLASS="Footer">Created by: <A HREF="mailto:OJB@mac.com">Owen Baxter</A>, Modified: 13 Mar 2002, Made with Macintosh</P><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan ALT="Site Meter" --><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">var site="s10OJB-ling"</script><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2" src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/js/counter.js?site=s10OJB-ling"></script><noscript><a href="http://s10.sitemeter.com/stats.asp?site=s10OJB-ling" target="_top"><img src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/meter.asp?site=s10OJB-ling" alt="Site Meter" border=0></a></noscript><!-- Copyright (c)2000 Site Meter --><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" Endspan --></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
