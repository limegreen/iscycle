One likely reason for this dominance is the apparently very uniform influence of American media world-wide--what we have referred to as "pax Americana". This includes popular music, films, clothing styles, fast food, and of course television. It is interesting to examine the percentages of locally made versus foreign television programmes in the four Anglophone nations surveyed to date:</P><P>Amount of local content in television programming by nation.<BR>(Excludes pay TV; hence percentages are less than 100%; % share and % local refer to overall share  of viewing audience and percent of local content.)<BR>(Source: New Zealand on Air, Local Content and Diversity; Television in Ten Countries.

However, note that the NAm voice also rated well above the two EE voices as far as the sample of <a href="../Results/EngCorn.html"><u>Cornish schoolchildren</u></a> is concerned, so obviously proportion of American television is only one rather crude index in a complex picture of global US influence. <P><P>As an example of this influence, we list below the range of English-language TV programmes screening in Finland in early 2000, at the time we obtained out sample of opinion there; note that of almost 50 programmes, only a handful (italicised*) are not American in origin.  The American programmes listed below are screened in New Zealand and Australia, and as well in Sweden and Singapore. A Norwegian scholar has assured Bayard that the lineup on Norwegian television is also almost identical (Bjarne Vandeskog, p.c.).

In nations like Germany, Austria, and France most English-language programmes are dubbed into German or French.  In smaller nations like the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries English-language programmes are transmitted in their original accents. We have so far surveyed three countries where English is a second language only: Finland, Sweden, and Germany. The first two broadcast English-language programmes undubbed, while Germany dubs most of its English-language programmes. This is reflected in the hours listeners reported viewing undubbed English-language programmes. We used a scale of 1 to five for this variable:</P><P>1 = zero hours per week<BR>2 = 1- 4 hours per week<BR>3 = 5-9 hours per week<BR>4 = 10 - 19 hours per week<BR>5 = 20 hours + hours per week</P><P>On this scale, Finland had an average of 2.78--about 5 hours per week. Sweden had a mean of 3.25--about 6 or 7 hours per week. But Germany averaged only 1.42--less than one hour per week of undubbed English-language viewing.</P><P><b> To date, our results show little evidence of a <i>direct</i> correlation between the dubbing variable and accent ratings, but further investigations are pending.</b></P><HR><P CLASS="Footer">Created by: <A HREF="mailto:OJB@mac.com">Owen Baxter</A>, Modified: 13 Mar 2002, Made with Macintosh</P><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan ALT="Site Meter" --><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">var site="s10OJB-ling"</script><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2" src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/js/counter.js?site=s10OJB-ling"></script><noscript><a href="http://s10.sitemeter.com/stats.asp?site=s10OJB-ling" target="_top"><img src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/meter.asp?site=s10OJB-ling" alt="Site Meter" border=0></a></noscript><!-- Copyright (c)2000 Site Meter --><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" Endspan --></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
