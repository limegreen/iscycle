As mentioned in the<A HREF="../Methods/Methods.html">Methods</A> section, it has been recognised for years (e.g., Giles and Powesland1975: 90) that paralinguistic variation in things like speed of speech, number ofhesitations, and intonational variability do have an important effect on listenerevaluations, and every effort was made to control these as much as possible. While we were successful in keeping variability in speed and hesitations to aminimum, intonation is much harder to control for. Several people have commentedto us about the monotonous reading tone of the male NZE speaker and wondered ifit was related to his low ratings by almost all of the groups surveyed so far. The converse is true for the lively, variable intonation of the female NAm voiceand her uniformly high ratings by all groups.  What we are concerned with here isnot the normal physical variation in intonation between males and females, but inwhat has been called "pitch dynamism"&#151;roughly, the amount of overall variabilityof intonation in a speech segment.  Although this term is far from satisfactory(Daly and Warren 2001: 87-88), there is certainly variability in the amount ofpitch dynamism in the voices used here, and it is important to try to judge the amountof impact this variability has on evaluations.</P><P><B>Judging the impact: samples</B></P><P>The question is an important one for this study and many others, and we wishedto investigate the problem in some depth.  Since we already had a large sample ofnative-English-speaking New Zealanders (257) and a relatively large sample of L2speakers of English from Sweden (115), we decided to use these two countries fortesting.  This would also allow a check on differences in impact on native versusnon-native speakers.Sullivan first produced two new versions of the stimulusaccent tape through digital manipulation of the sound.  The first versioninvolved anchoring all eight voices to a basically "flat" F0 frequency to producewhat we nicknamed the "Dalek" tape (after Dr Who's monotone robots).  The secondtape used for its F0 the intonation patterns of the two NAm voices, each appliedto the other six voices according to the relevant gender.  At Ume&aring;University Sullivan played the flat F0 tape for 44 Swedish students (not used inthe original test), while the NAm F0 version was heard by 31 new students.  Atthe University of Otago Bayard and Green played the flat and  NAm tape to samples of 46and 110 students.  We thus hadadequate to large samples of opinion from both universities in all threeconditions: </P>  <Center><IMG SRC="TonesamplesT1.gif" WIDTH=399 HEIGHT=127 BORDER=0 ALT="Tone samples"></center><P><B>Judging the impact: results</B></P><P>A) Flat intonation<BR></P><P>The results show that intonational variation does indeed have a very significanteffect on listener evaluations.  Manovas of all 22 traits used in our evaluationswere performed contrasting flat versus normal intonation and the normal versusNAm pattern.  In the case of both Swedish and New Zealand listeners the flattonal pattern lowered d the meaning ratings of all traits to a highly significant(<I>p</I> < .000) degree.<SUP>1</SUP>    Intonation had its greatest impact on thesolidarity-associated traits, followed by those associated with competence, thenpower, and had the smallest effects on the four status traits.  Flat intonationalso had a marked effect on all mean speaker scores except for the male EE voiceas heard by New Zealanders.  In all cases this effect lowers the mean speakerscore, except for the male NZE voice, which is raised by listeners from bothnations.</P><center><IMG SRC="NZDalekT1.gif" WIDTH=473 HEIGHT=155 BORDER=0 ALT="Dalek Table"></center><P>B) American "expressive" intonation</P>The effects of the NAm intonational pattern are not as clear-cut as with flatintonation, but they are still highly significant.  In general, the mean valuesfor both traits and speakers are lowered vis-a-vis normal intonation.  TheSwedish listeners lower the means for seven power traits (strong voice,ambitious, dominant, assertive, controlling, powerful voice, and authoritative)to a highly significant degree, but no others are affected.<SUP>2</SUP></P><center><IMG SRC="NZYanktoneT1.gif" WIDTH=467 HEIGHT=164 BORDER=0 ALT="Yanktone table"></CENTER><P>In the case of  New Zealand effects are more variable.  NAm intonation lowers themeans for 13 traits significantly, but also raises the status traits on income (<I>p</I>= .043) and class (<I>p</I> = .444&#151;n.s.). The means for five of the eight speakers(female AusE, female NZE, male AusE, female NAm, male NAm) are loweredsignificantly by Swedish listeners, but the mean for the monotonous male NZE voiceis raised from 2.2 to 2.8 (<I>p</I> < .000).  New Zealand listeners also lower means forthe same five speakers, but raise not only the male NZE voice but the male EEspeaker as well.</P><P>In terms of variation in individual traits, this is most easily presented byusing separate graphs for perceived flat, normal, and NAm intonation means.  Wepresent only those for the New Zealand data, as it is based on larger samples;the Swedish data are essentially similar.</P><CENTER><P><B>A.

Note that mean values for both NAm speakers are lowered when NAmintonation is applied to the other six voices as well.  All others are alsolowered except for the male NZE and male EE voices.  Hence it seems a case can bemade for the widely recognised NAm phonology and its  associations contributing to their high scores.</LI><LI>However, the NZE male voice is raised by addition of NAm intonation, so it doeshelp to combat the negative effect of tonal flatness.</LI><LI>Status trait means and the male EE speaker means are the least affected by NAmintonation, although it does raise (slightly) mean values for class and income. It thus seems likely that phonological characteristics of Near-RP accents, ratherthan any associated intonational pattern, convey the status connotationstraditionally associated with the accent.</LI></UL></P><P><B>In general then, while intonation is clearly important, phonological accentappears to have the greater effect.  Obviously further research along the linesused here would prove of great value.</B></P><P>NOTES<BR>1.  For those interested in the exact statistics.
