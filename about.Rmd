title: "About James"

* PhD 2004, University of Otago

My name is not A. James Green, but James A. Green. Having a super common name
(Hi other person called 
<a href = "https://psych.uconn.edu/person/james-green/">James A. Green</a> 
who is also a psychology PhD!!), I needed to find a unique handle, and 
theJamesGreen seemed a bit pretentious. So I'm just aJamesGreen, one of many!
