I am a researcher and teacher at the [School of Allied Health](https://www.ul.ie/schoolalliedhealth/), [University of   Limerick](https://www.ul.ie). I am also a member of the [Physical Activity *for* Health](https://www.ul.ie/hri/physical-activity-health-pafh) Research Cluster at the Health Research Institute. Previously, I was based at the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz) in Aotearoa/New Zealand. 

My interests are interdisciplinary and broad, but can be grouped into:  

* __Health__ — I apply psychology to questions in health. A lot of what I do is quite culturally located, trying to understand health behaviour in different locations: Indonesia, Pakistan, New Zealand, Ireland. Recent specific projects include looking at the use of various substances for improving academic performance, using n-of-1 interventions to increase physical activity, and publication bias in health fields. 

* __Data/Methods__ — My very first research project in my third year of university used multivariate 
statistics, and I was teaching assistant for a third year statistics paper in the first year of my PhD, and have been teaching statistics/research methods on and off ever since. I support openness and transparency,
and have recently published a paper promoting the use count regression (Poisson, negative binomial etc.). I am also very interested in publication bias.  

* __Education__ — Having spent many years doing admissions for health professional programmes, I've done some work on admissions processes. I also recently completed a Masters in Teaching & Learning, with my dissertation looking at increasing student engagement with research methods courses.

* __Wine__ — I don't really do this much any more, but historically, I've done quite a bit looking at perception of flavour in wine, mostly Sauvignon blanc.  

* __Coffee__ — Just kidding. Even my interests are not that broad. I do drink a lot of coffee, and we roast our own green beans.  
* __Random__ — There could be more sub-headings here, but along the way, I've been involved on lots of other projects. Some of my much older/original work was in sociolinguistics, and there are lots of things I've got involved in with friends.
