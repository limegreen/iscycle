Itpresented the results of surveys in three non-Anglophone European countries toinvestigate the influence of English-language television broadcasts on accentratings (see Influence).   An overall factor analysis of all three nationsrevealed the same clear-cut division of the 22 personality traits used into thebasic dimensions of <B>status, power, solidarity,</B> and <B>competence </B> thatwas so evident in the results from the three Anglophone nations (Bayard,Weatherall, Gallois, and Pittam 2001).  However, data was also gathered onEnglish-language television viewing habits: programmes watched and number ofhours per week.  Two of the nations surveyed&#151;Sweden andFinland&#151;broadcast all English-language programmes in their original accents,as the relatively low number of speakers of each of the native languages madedubbing uneconomic.  However, the German sample reflects a country in which allEnglish programmes are dubbed into German. </P> <P> Although there isconsiderable evidence suggesting that the NAm accent is replacing RP as preferredstandard model in Western Europe (van der Haagen 1998, Mob&#228;rg 1999&#151;butcf. Ladegaard 1998), no significant differences were found between Englishtelevision viewing hours and NAm vs. RP accent ratings; however, much more studyis needed, with a larger sample of "dubbing" and "non-dubbing" nations.  It doesseem safe to conclude that influences from other media (films, pop music,advertisements, etc) also play an important part in the rise of NAm as a globalstandard. </P> <P> Bayard and his research assistant James Green have begun theinvestigation of national and ethnic variation in the emphasis on the four basicdimensions of <B>status, power, solidarity,</B> and <B>competence</B> (see <AHREF="../Results/Xcultcomp.html">Cross-cultural research</A>). Sullivan andBayard are examining the effects of speaker intonation on listener evaluation bythe digital manipulation of the eight stimulus voices to produce two new tapes:one of these has a "flat" F0 intonation pattern, and the other uses the lively,tonally variable speech styles of the two NAm voices as a model for the other sixvoices. This provides us with one stimulus having minimal tonal variation and asecond with the maximum tonal variability found in our eight stimulus voices. They have administered these to groups where we already have a large sample ofresponses to the "normal" stimulus tape, namely Sweden and New Zealand.  For someresults see <A HREF="../Intonation/Intonation.html">The Impact of Intonation</A>). </P> <P> France Mugler (University of the South Pacific) islooking at the differences in accuracy of accent identification between Fijiansand Indo-Fijians and at the effect of speaker gender on the attribution of socialstatus and personality traits. </P><HR><P CLASS="Footer"> Created by: <A HREF="mailto:OJB@mac.com">Owen Baxter</A>,Modified: 13 Mar 2002, Made with Macintosh </P><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan ALT="Site Meter" --> <scripttype="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">var site="s10OJB-ling"</script><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/js/counter.js?site=s10OJB-ling"> </script><noscript> <a href="http://s10.sitemeter.com/stats.asp?site=s10OJB-ling"target="_top"> <img src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/meter.asp?site=s10OJB-ling"alt="Site Meter" border=0></a> </noscript> <!-- Copyright (c)2000 Site Meter --><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" Endspan --></TD> </TR> </TABLE></CENTER></BODY> </HTML>
