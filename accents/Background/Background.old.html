He found that a large number of New Zealand listeners had difficulty in correctly identifying the one Australian voice used on his stimulus tape; it was frequently assumed to be a fellow New Zealander.</P><P>Weatherall and her students became interested in this in the mid-1990s, and Weatherall and Gallois decided to test ease of identification of the broad-to-cultivated range of both accents to see how accurately New Zealanders and Australians could tell their accents apart. They used a tape with male and female voices in the broad (stereotypical "Crocodile Dundee"), general, and cultivated (i.e., approaching RP) ranges of both accents plus a practice voice; this made a total of 13 voices. See Weatherall, Gallois, and Pittam 2000 for details. Weatherall presented details of this research at a New Zealand linguistics conference in 1998, and she and Bayard decided to carry out joint research, widening the scope to include nations other than Australia and New Zealand. </P><P> As well as Gallois in Queensland who was already involved, Ray at Cleveland State University, and Sullivan at Ume&aring; became involved.  After the establishment of this website, interest in the project quickly grew until at present (March 2002) we have about 20 scholars in 14 nations involved.  We now have adequate to large samples of opinion from New Zealand, Australia, Ohio (USA), England (Cornwall), Sweden, Germany, Finland, Singapore, Fiji, and Hong Kong.  Samples from York University (England), and International Christian University (Japan) are currently being processed, and we are anticipating samples to arrive from North England, Ireland, France, Norway, Poland, Nigeria, and Luoyang, China.</p><p><b>Further participants from China, South and Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America would be most welcome.</b></P><HR><P CLASS="Footer">Created by: <A HREF="mailto:OJB@mac.com">Owen Baxter</A>, Modified: 13 Mar 2002, Made with Macintosh</P><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan ALT="Site Meter" --><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">var site="s10OJB-ling"</script><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2" src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/js/counter.js?site=s10OJB-ling"></script><noscript><a href="http://s10.sitemeter.com/stats.asp?site=s10OJB-ling" target="_top"><img src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/meter.asp?site=s10OJB-ling" alt="Site Meter" border=0></a></noscript><!-- Copyright (c)2000 Site Meter --><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" Endspan --></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
