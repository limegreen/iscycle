Thelarge "other" category includes "Scottish" (7%) and "Asian" (11%) for the femaleEE; and "Scottish" (15%) and "Asian" (7%) for the male EE voice. Since they werenot recognised as "English" by the great majority of listeners, this does notseem to be due to any negative feeling about the former colonial administration.</LI></UL> <P> <A NAME="Perceived"><H4 style="color: red"> Perceived Comprehension of Accents </A></H4><P> We were able to obtain evaluations (scored on a six-point Likert scale) fromthe Hong Kong and Japanese students on the relative ease of understanding of theeight voices used in our test.  The results are presented below.  From these, itis quite clear that the two NAm voices&#151;the female NAm voice inparticular&#151;were perceived of as the easiest to understand by the Japanesestudents. These are followed by the two AusE voices and the NZE female voice. TheEE male and female voices follow for the Japanese, with the NZE male in bottomplace. </P> <P> The Hong Kong students scored themselves somewhat lower onoverall comprehension. For these students, the AusE and NZE female voices are inthird and fourth place, followed by the male Australian.  Once again the twoEnglish voices and the NZE male are the most difficult to understand.  Theposition of the two EE voices at the bottom for Hong Kong as well as Japanesestudents is interesting, given the use of RP as a standard for teaching Englishin Hong Kong schools for many years. </P> <P> As the two NAm accents lead in both student groups, familiarity with this accentthrough media exposure seems likely to account for its high comprehension rate. Given our largely successful attempts to control for reading speed and number ofhesitations, it is possible that intonation also plays a considerable part incomprehension (see <A HREF="../Intonation/Intonation.html">The Impact of Intonation</A>).  Clearly more research with different groups at different levels of English study would repay the effort.</P><P> <B>Perceived ease of comprehension of eight voices  <BR> by Hong Kongstudents (<U>H</U>; N = 75) <BR> and Japanese students (<U>J</U>; N = 133) </B></P><IMG SRC="HKJcomp.GIF" WIDTH=487 HEIGHT=384 BORDER=0 ALT="Ease of comprehension"><P><P CLASS="Footer"> Created by: <A HREF="mailto:OJB@mac.com">Owen Baxter</A>,Modified: 25 Jun 2002, Made with Macintosh </P><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan ALT="Site Meter" --> <scripttype="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">var site="s10OJB-ling"</script><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/js/counter.js?site=s10OJB-ling"> </script><noscript> <a href="http://s10.sitemeter.com/stats.asp?site=s10OJB-ling"target="_top"> <img src="http://s10.sitemeter.com/meter.asp?site=s10OJB-ling"alt="Site Meter" border=0></a> </noscript> <!-- Copyright (c)2000 Site Meter --><!--WEBBOT bot="HTMLMarkup" Endspan --></TD> </TR> </TABLE></CENTER></BODY> </HTML>
