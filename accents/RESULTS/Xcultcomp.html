Do all humansocieties share an essentially identical view of the different elements which arecombined to make up an individual's personality, or are there noteworthydifferences in the various constellations of traits which different cultures viewas significant?  Anthropological studies like Benedict's famous <I>Patterns ofCulture</I> (1934) or Phillips' <I>Thai Peasant Personality</I> (1965) are rather uncommonat present, but social psychologists have taken up the debate, some arguing thatpersonality configurations and values are more or less universal across culturalboundaries&#151;the <I>etic</I> approach (e.g., Schwartz and Bilsky 1990, McCrae and Costa1997); and those who believe considerable cultural variation exists&#151;the <I>emic</I>approach<SUP>1</SUP> (e.g.,  Chinese Cultural Connection 1987, Cheung et al. 2001).  Bayard'santhropological background and an earlier study he carried out on Thai accentsand attitudes (Bayard 1995) suggest to him that the emic approach is moreprobably correct. </P><P> One of the benefits of the EEAWW project is the accumulation of a large body ofdata from representative samples of listeners in different national and ethnicgroups.  All of these have been exposed to the identical stimulus of eightvoices, scored on 22 personality, voice, and status traits using essentiallyidentical questionnaires.  This provides the basis for some intriguingcross-cultural comparisons of the overall <B>dimensions</B> used to construct culturalmodels of personality, and variability in the relative importance of thesedimensions.</P><P>We have only just begun to explore the EEAWW data, but here is an example fromthe nine-nation sample of university student evaluations available to date (March2002).  We employ a technique called <B>principal components</B> or <B>factor analysis</B> toexamine the relationships (correlations) between the various personality traitsused in evaluation to see how these are grouped into larger overall dimensions or<B>factors</B>.  If we limit ourselves to the 13 personality traits alone, omitting thefive voice traits and four fixed-option status traits, PC analysis of the  sampleof 682 listeners drawn from six Western nations<SUP>2</SUP> provides three clear-cutfactors.</P><CENTER><P><B>A.<BR>PC ANALYSIS OF 13 PERSONALITY TRAIT MEANS:<BR>SIX  NATIONAL/ETHNIC GROUPS (N = 682)<BR>(TRAITS LOADING AT >± 0.5 <U>UNDERLINED)</U></B><BR></P><IMG SRC="13PC682.gif" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=307 BORDER=0 ALT="FA of 682 Westerners"></CENTER><P>It is clear the basic dimensions distinguished are those traditionally found insuch studies, and  are usually called power (also called control or status), solidarity (also known as affiliation, social attractiveness, etc.), and competence (basic dependability, intelligence, ambition, etc.). The firstdimension or factor is <B>competence;</B> the second factor in importance is what we've called <B>power</B> (controlling, dominant, assertive, etc.), and the third factor is clearly <B>solidarity</B> (friendly, warm, humorous, etc.).  Each of these three factors accounts for about one-quarter of the variance in the sample.  The remaining quarter of the variance is presumably due to other features of speaker evaluation not included in the traits used here.</P><P>As stated, these three factors&#151;with the same or different labels&#151;occur againand again in studies like this carried out in North America and Europe.  But whatsort of patterns emerge in non-Western societies?  Bayard's study of 62 Thailistening to four Thai accents (1995) produced three factors which could ratherbe labelled self-esteem, esteem for others, and status.  Our samples from HongKong and Singapore enable us to analyse the evaluations of a fairly large sampleof Chinese university students (46 of the 56 from the National University ofSingapore  and all 75 of those from Hong Kong Baptist University).  When the sametechnique of factor analysis is applied to this sample of 121, a somewhatdifferent picture emerges, as shown below.</P><CENTER><P><B>B.<BR>PC ANALYSIS OF 13 PERSONALITY TRAIT MEANS:<BR>HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE ETHNIC CHINESE  (N = 121)<BR>(COMPETENCE TRAITS <I>ITALICISED</I>; <BR>TRAITS LOADING AT >± 0.5 <U>UNDERLINED</U>)<BR></B></P><IMG SRC="13PC121.gif" WIDTH=294 HEIGHT=294 BORDER=0 ALT="FA of 121 Chinese"></CENTER><P>Here only two factors emerge, if we use the conventionally accepted cutoff pointfor generating factors.<SUP>3</SUP> These appear to be solidarity and power, with thetraits assigned to a distinct competence dimension in the Western sample distributed between the two. Solidarity contains <I>intelligent, hard-working,</I> and <I>reliable</I>&#151;all traitsapparently valued in friends and acquaintances; while power also has <I>competent</I>and <I>ambitious</I> included along with the usual traits.  All of these distributedfactors also show high values on the other factor, as would be expected.  The two factors together account for approximately three-quarters of the variance, about the same as the three factors in the Western sample.</P><P>It should be noted that this pattern also emerges when each of the two Chinesesamples are analysed separately.  When all 22 traits are analysed for the totaluniversity sample, a fourth status factor emerges consisting of the fourfixed-option traits (income, occupation, education, social class); the five voicetraits are variously assigned to the other three factors.  But here again, when the Chinesesubsample alone is considered, only three factors emerge: solidarity with thesame three competence factors (plus pleasant, attractive, and educated voice), power with the same two competence factors (plus strong and powerful voice), and athird status factor.  The implication we take from this is that competence per seis not viewed as a clear-cut dimension separate from the other two, as it appearsto be in most Western societies.  Instead, it forms an integral part of thesolidarity and power dimensions.</P><H4 style="color: red">New Data: Japan</H4><P>Since the text above was posted in April, we have completed processing of a largesample of questionnaires from International Christian University, Tokyo (see <ahref="Japan.html"><u>Japan</u></a>).  Instead of producing the fourfactors found in the Western data, these responses follow the samepatterns as the Singapore and Hong Kong Chinese.<CENTER><P><B>C.<BR>PC ANALYSIS OF 13 PERSONALITY TRAIT MEANS:<BR>133 NATIVE-BORN JAPANESE STUDENTS,<BR> INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY.<BR>(COMPETENCE TRAITS <I>ITALICISED</I>; <BR>TRAITS LOADING AT >± 0.5 <U>UNDERLINED</U>)<BR></B></P><IMG SRC="13PCJapan.gif" WIDTH=298 HEIGHT=292 BORDER=0 ALT="13-FA of 133 Japanese"></CENTER></P> <P>In this case Factor 1 (35.7% of variance after rotation) contains the fourpower traits plus <I>competent, intelligent,</I> and <I>hard-working.</I>  Factor2 (35.3% of variance) contains the four solidarity variables plus<I>ambitious</I> and <I>reliable.</I></P><P>The parallel pattern is  found in the full analysis of all 22 traits, here presented in full:</P><CENTER><P><B>D.<BR>PC ANALYSIS OF 22 PERSONALITY TRAIT MEANS:<BR>133 NATIVE-BORN JAPANESE STUDENTS,<BR> INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY.<BR>(COMPETENCE TRAITS <I>ITALICISED</I>; <BR>TRAITS LOADING AT >± 0.5 <U>UNDERLINED</U>)<BR></B></P><IMG SRC="22PCJapan.gif" WIDTH=425 HEIGHT=471 BORDER=0 ALT="22-FA of 133 Japanese"></CENTER><P>Here, as with the 121 Chinese, we find only three factors rather than the four wehave encountered in all the non-East Asian samples.  Factor 1 is clearlysolidarity, with the addition of the same competence traits (<I>ambitious</I> and<I>reliable,</I> plus <I>pleasant, attractive,</I> and powerful voice). Factor 2 is power plus <i>intelligent</I> and <I>hard-working</I>, as well as<I>educated</I> and strong voice.  Factor 3 contains only the four statustraits of income, class, education, and occupation.</P><P>Thus while the distribution of the competence traits is not identical, theresemblance in compression of factors between Chinese and Japanese students isin marked contrast to the other student samples, and does suggest some actualamount of cross-cultural variation in the grouping of personality traits to makeculturally significant personality dimensions.  It would be interesting to seewhat the analysis of a body of Korean student opinion would produce.</P><P>At the very least these results indicate the potential the sort of datagathered by the EEAWW Project has for exploratory cross-cultural studies. </P><P><B>NOTES</B><BR>   1.
